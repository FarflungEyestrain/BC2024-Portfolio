    <div class = "p2"><img src = "images/unnamed.jpg" class="image2" id="profile image">
    <p>My name is Gavin Stedge-Endris and I am 18 years old. At graduation I received a certificate of completion for the Engineering Program at the Hoosier Hills Career Center. I currently work part time at the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University in the Facilities Department. For the past four years I volunteered with the North chapter of the Habitat for Humanity.  In my spare time I like to draw and sketch, both digitally and on paper. I have a dog named Daisy, she is a 12 year old pug mix.</p> </div>
