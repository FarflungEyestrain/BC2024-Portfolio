    <div class = "p2"><p> My name is Gavin Stedge-Endris. I am 18 years old with a high school diploma, and am currently working a part-time job at the IU Kelley School as an hourly. I had a previous job working as a dishwasher at Jeresy Mikes before I moved on. I have some skills in coding with CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. I like to draw and sketch both digitally and on paper. I have a dog named Dasiy. She is 9 years old.</p> </div>
